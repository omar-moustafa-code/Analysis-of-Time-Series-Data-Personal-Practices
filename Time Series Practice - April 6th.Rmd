This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

To compute the sample PACF, we replace the theoretical ACF p's with the sample ACF r's

AR(1) Example:
Xt = 0.8Xt-1 + Et
```{r}
ar.sim = arima.sim(model = list(c(0.8)), n = 100)
ts.plot(ar.sim)
```

To Calculate the ACF:
```{r}
ar.acf = acf(ar.sim, type = "correlation", plot = T, main = "ACF of AR(1)")
```

To Calculate the PACF:
```{r}
ar.pacf = pacf(ar.sim, plot = T, main = "PACF of AR(1)")
```


MA(1) Example:
Xt = Et + 0.8Et-1
```{r}
ma.sim = arima.sim(model = list(c(0.8)), n = 100)
plot.ts(ma.sim)
```

To Calculate the ACF:
```{r}
ma.acf = acf(ma.sim, type = "correlation", plot = T, , main = "PACF of MA(1)")
```


To Calculate the PACF:
```{r}
ma.pacf = pacf(ma.sim, plot = T, main = "PACF of MA(1)")
```


ARMA(2, 1) Example:
Xt = 1.3Xt-1 - 0.4Xt-2 + Et + 0.4Et-1
```{r}
arma.sim = arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(1.3, -0.4), ma = c(0.4)), n = 100)
ts.plot(arma.sim)
```

To Calculate the ACF and the PACF:
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
arma.acf = acf(arma.sim, type = "correlation", plot = T, main = "ACF of ARMA(2,1)")
arima.pacf = pacf(arma.sim, plot = T, main = "PACF of ARMA(2,1)")
```
